							<h3><b>12. Dispute Resolution</b></h3>
							</header>
							<header>
								<h4><b>Governing Law</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</br>
							</p>

							<header>
								<h4><b>Agreement to Arbitrate</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>You and 1815443 Ontario LTD. agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court (a “Small Claims Action”) and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of Ontario and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide 1815443 Ontario LTD. with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the Section titled “Your Choices”), you acknowledge and agree that you and 1815443 Ontario LTD. are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and 1815443 Ontario LTD. otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</br>
							</p>


							<header>
								<h4><b>Arbitration Rules</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>The arbitration will be administered by the Canadian Arbitration Association (“CAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “CAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The CAA Rules are available at canadianarbitrationassociation.ca or by calling the CAA at 1–800–856-5154.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</br>
							</p>

							<header>
								<h4><b>Arbitration Process</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the CAA Rules. (The CAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the CAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the CAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the CAA Rules.</br>
							</p>

							<header>
								<h4><b>Arbitration Location and Procedure</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>Unless you and 1815443 Ontario LTD. otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and 1815443 Ontario LTD. submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the CAA Rules. Subject to the CAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</br>
							</p>

							<header>
								<h4><b>Arbitrator’s Decision</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the CAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. 1815443 Ontario LTD. will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</br>
							</p>

							<header>
								<h4><b>Fees</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>Your responsibility to pay any CAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the CAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, 1815443 Ontario LTD. will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</br>
							</p>

							<header>
								<h4><b>Changes</b></h4>
							</header>
							<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “General Terms” section below regarding changes to these Terms, if 1815443 Ontario LTD. changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@glimpsesocial.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of 1815443 Ontario LTD.’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and 1815443 Ontario LTD. in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</br>
							</p>

							<header>
								<h4><b>Your Choices</b></h4>
							</header>
